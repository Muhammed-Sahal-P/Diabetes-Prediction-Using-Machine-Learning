# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
### Capstone Project - Machine Learning
### Project Overview 
This project focuses on predicting diabetes-related hospital readmission using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset.
The dataset contains medical records of diabetic patients across 130 hospitals in the U.S., including demographic details, lab test results, medications, and previous hospital visits.

The primary goal is to apply machine learning techniques to identify key factors influencing hospital readmission rates and develop a predictive model.

## Dataset Details
• Source: Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset

• Size: Over 100,000 records

• Features: 50+ attributes, including patient demographics, test results, medications, and hospital visit details

• Target Variable: Readmission status (e.g., ‹30 days, >30 days, No readmission)
